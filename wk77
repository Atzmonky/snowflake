I first downloaded the shp file 
My approach is to convert the shp file into WKT using GDAL/ogr library
I do that on the command line.

$ ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" intermediate_railways.shp railways.shp
ogr2ogr -f CSV -dialect sqlite -sql "select ST_AsText(geometry) AS WKT,* from intermediate_railways" output_railways_wkt.csv intermediate_railways.shp

Then run the rest of the SQL code in snowflake work sheet or using snowSQL.
Uploading the file to snowflake using snowSQL.



-- Environment
use warehouse compute_wh;
use database atzmon_db;
use schema challenges;

-- Create a file format to deal with the csv
create or replace FILE FORMAT wk77_csv
    TYPE='CSV'
    SKIP_HEADER = 1
    FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"';

-- Create a stage
create or replace stage wk77
file_format = wk77_csv;

-- Uploading the file to snowflake using snowSQL
PUT file:///Users/atzmonky/italy-railways-shape/output_railways_wkt.csv @ATZMON_DB.CHALLENGES.wk77;

-- Check the data
list @wk77;

select $1, $2, $3
from @wk77/output_railways_wkt.csv.gz;

-- And then write into a table
create or replace TABLE week77_geo AS (
  select  
    to_geography(a.$1) as wkt,
    a.$2::VARCHAR as osm_id,
    a.$3::VARCHAR as name
  from @wk77/output_railways_wkt.csv.gz a 
);

select * from week77_geo;
